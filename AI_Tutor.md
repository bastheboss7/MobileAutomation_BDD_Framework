Teaching Objectives - Cover these topics in order:

1. **What is BDD and Why Use It?**
   - Explain Behavior-Driven Development in simple terms
   - Given-When-Then format with real examples
   - How it bridges the gap between business and technical teams

2. **Understanding the Page Object Model (POM)**
   - Why we separate locators from test logic
   - The inheritance hierarchy: BasePage → LoginScreen
   - How it makes tests maintainable

3. **The Factory Pattern in Action**
   - What DriverFactory does and why
   - How it creates Android vs iOS drivers
   - Atomic port allocation for parallel execution
   - Real-world analogy: A car factory that builds different models

4. **Thread Safety with ThreadLocal**
   - Why DriverManager uses ThreadLocal
   - Parallel execution challenges
   - Simple analogy: Each thread has its own "locker"

5. **Multi-Environment Configuration**
   - How ConfigManager loads layered properties
   - Priority: System props → config-{env}.properties → config.properties
   - Switching between local/staging/prod

6. **The Test Execution Flow**
   - Trace a test from feature file to execution:
     Feature → Runner → Hooks → Step Definitions → Page Objects → Driver
   - What happens at each stage

7. **Reporting Architecture**
   - Extent Reports vs Cucumber Reports
   - Configurable screenshot strategy
   - How ExtentReportListener manages lifecycle

8. **Retry Mechanism for Mobile Flakiness**
   - Why mobile tests are flaky
   - How RetryAnalyzer and RetryTransformer work
   - Configuration via retry.maxCount

9. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow structure
   - Azure DevOps pipeline configuration
   - Docker Compose for Appium Grid

10. **Practical Exercises for the Engineer**
    - Add a new screen (e.g., HomeScreen)
    - Create a new feature file for Forms screen
    - Run tests on a different platform/environment

11. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
    - Hardcoded waits vs explicit waits
    - XPath vs Accessibility IDs
    - Not cleaning up drivers
    - Forgetting to start Appium server

Format Requirements:
- Use headers and bullet points for clarity
- Include code snippets where helpful
- Add "💡 Pro Tip" sections for advanced insights
- Include "⚠️ Common Mistake" warnings
- End with a "🎯 Key Takeaways" summary
- Use emojis sparingly for visual appeal
- Keep explanations beginner-friendly but technically accurate

## 📱 Prompt: Starting Simulators & Emulators

```
I need help starting mobile simulators/emulators for my Appium tests.

My setup:
- macOS (for both Android and iOS)
- Appium 2.x with uiautomator2 and xcuitest drivers
- Android SDK installed
- Xcode installed

Please provide:
1. Step-by-step commands to list and start Android emulators
2. Step-by-step commands to list and start iOS simulators
3. How to verify the device is ready for Appium
4. How to get the UDID for my config.properties
5. Common troubleshooting for "device not found" errors
```

## 🔧 Additional Useful Prompts

### **Prompt: Debug a Test Failure**
```
I'm getting this error when running my Appium test:
[paste error here]

Framework context:
- Using DriverFactory with ThreadLocal
- TestNG + Cucumber integration
- Running on [Android/iOS]
- Environment: [local/staging/prod]

Help me understand:
1. What is the root cause?
2. Which file should I check?
3. How do I fix it?
```

### **Prompt: Add a New Page Object**
```
I need to add a new Page Object for the [Screen Name] screen in this framework.

The screen has these elements:
- [Element 1]: [description]
- [Element 2]: [description]

Following the existing pattern, generate:
1. Locator constants in com.automation.framework.pages.locators
2. Page Object class in com.automation.framework.pages.screens
3. Step definitions in src/test/java/stepdefinitions
4. Feature file in src/test/resources/features
```

### **Prompt: Create a New Feature File**
```
Create a Cucumber BDD feature file for testing [Feature Name].

Requirements:
- Follow Scenario Outline pattern with Examples table
- Use proper tags (@Smoke, @Regression, etc.)
- Include positive and negative test cases
- Match the style of wdioLogin.feature in this project
- Place in src/test/resources/features/
```

### **Prompt: Explain a Specific File**
```
Explain this file from my Mobile Automation Framework like I'm a junior engineer:

[Paste file content here]

Cover:
1. What is its purpose?
2. How does it fit into the overall architecture?
3. Key methods and what they do
4. How other files depend on it
```

### **Prompt: Review My Test Code**
```
Review this test code for best practices:

[Paste your code here]

Check for:
- Page Object Model violations
- Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Missing error handling
- Thread-safety issues for parallel execution
- Appium best practices
```

### **Prompt: Configure for Cloud Device Farm**
```
I want to run my tests on [BrowserStack/SauceLabs/AWS Device Farm].

Current config:
- Using config-{env}.properties pattern
- Appium 2.x with Java client 9.4.0
- TestNG + Cucumber

Help me:
1. Create a config-cloud.properties file
2. Update DriverFactory to support cloud capabilities
3. Set up CI/CD to use cloud devices
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Prompts

### **Appium Connection Issues**
```
My Appium test fails with "Could not start a new session".

Error message: [paste error]

Setup:
- Appium version: [version]
- Platform: [Android/iOS]
- Device: [emulator name or device]

Help me debug step by step.
```

### **Element Not Found**
```
My test fails with "NoSuchElementException" for element [element name].

I'm using:
- Locator strategy: [accessibility ID/XPath/etc]
- Locator value: [value]
- Platform: [Android/iOS]

The element is visible on screen. Why can't Appium find it?
```

### **Parallel Execution Issues**
```
My tests work individually but fail in parallel execution.

Symptoms:
- [describe what happens]

Framework uses:
- ThreadLocal DriverManager
- Atomic port allocation in DriverFactory

What could be causing thread-safety issues?
```
